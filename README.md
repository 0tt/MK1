# MK1
Native Instruments Maschine MK1 extension for Bitwig, with no compromises.

# Philosophy
Be efficient. Don't send any unnecessary data. Use the Controller Editor wherever possible. I'm going to write the documentation for this extension before I write any code so that I know what I'm doing and don't waste any effort with code rewrites.
